So what if you don't have time to fuss with fresh tomatoes? I've found the canned variety makes a fine substitute. Another advantage: Fresh tomatoes start to deteriorate as soon as the soup is refrigerated, but canned tomatoes are unaffected by the chill. <span> By</span> <span> Ben S.</span> <span> Great &#x27;n Easy Gazpacho</span> <h3> Great 'n Easy Gazpacho </h3> <span> Rating: 4.53 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 14 </span> I find that this recipe is just so easy! Even better with a food processor. Great way to eat loads of veggies. One of my favorites! <span> By</span> <span> Allyson Ben-Israel</span> <span> Lucky&#x27;s Gazpacho</span> <h3> Lucky's Gazpacho </h3> <span> Rating: 4.63 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 36 </span> A friend gave me her recipe and I reduced it to feed 4 instead of an army and tweaked it to our tastes. This is a wonderful cold soup bursting with garden freshness in every bite. Adjust the ingredients to suit your tastes or to use the bounty in your garden. And it doesn't heat up the kitchen on those hot summer days! Garnish with fresh parsley, chives, dollops of sour cream, and toast. Chill at least 1 hour; it is better the next day. <span> By</span> <span> Lucky Noodles</span> <span> Cold Russian Borscht</span> <h3> Cold Russian Borscht </h3> <span> Rating: 4.44 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 15 </span> Can you say 'Delicious?' <span> By</span> <span> GXO</span> <span> Vichyssoise</span> <h3> Vichyssoise </h3> <span> Rating: 4.54 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 54 </span> The finest of all cold soups--and the very best thing invented in the USA! This wonderful, smooth soup can be garnished with a very few finely chopped chives. The chef at the Algonquin (where the soup originated) now sprinkles a very little curry powder, and provided it is a VERY little this can be very pleasant. Enjoy. <span> By</span> <span> Derek Parker</span> <span> Mango Gazpacho</span> <h3> Mango Gazpacho </h3> <span> Rating: 4.46 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 71 </span> Serve this intriguing variation of gazpacho at your next summer gathering. <span> By</span> <span> USA WEEKEND columnist Pam Anderson</span> <span> Chef John&#x27;s White Gazpacho</span> <span> </span> <h3> Chef John's White Gazpacho </h3> <span> Rating: 4.46 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 9 </span> This is similar to a classic gazpacho, but with no tomato and peppers. <span> By</span> <span> Chef John</span> <span> Dill Gazpacho</span> <h3> Dill Gazpacho </h3> <span> Rating: 4.55 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 44 </span> A fresh and mild gazpacho that takes advantage of all that summer has to offer. Super easy too. Garnish with a sprig of fresh dill and serve chilled. <span> By</span> <span> Amy</span> <span> Simple Sweet Potato Soup</span> <h3> Simple Sweet Potato Soup </h3> <span> Rating: 4.11 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 21 </span> This delicious soup has only 6 ingredients. It was given to me by my boyfriend's mom who adapted it from another recipe. It can be as thick or thin as you like, and I like it quite thick. To dress it up when serving, drizzle some cream on top and float a lime twist or slice of lime on top. Delicious hot or cold. <span> By</span> <span> S Mcc</span> <span> Avocado Gazpacho</span> <h3> Avocado Gazpacho </h3> <span> Rating: 4.89 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 14 </span> Chunks of fresh avocado are combined with a fresh, bright broth to make a refreshing chilled soup. <span> By</span> <span> LUNATERIAN</span> <span> Spanish Gazpacho</span> <span> </span> <h3> Spanish Gazpacho </h3> <span> Rating: 4.86 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 6 </span> What's better on a hot summer's day than a classic chilled gazpacho?

The fresh taste of the sauce shines through with the addition of fresh cucumber, bell peppers, tomatoes, and basil. Add as much hot sauce as you dare to create the perfect cold soup for hot summer. This recipe is also gluten free. <span> By</span> <span> Classico</span> <span> Sponsored By Classico</span> <span> Andalusian Gazpacho</span> <h3> Andalusian Gazpacho </h3> <span> Rating: 3.61 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 16 </span> This is a wonderful recipe for a spicy cold tomato soup.
