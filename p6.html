Boom: You've got lunch or dinner ready to go. </p> By <span> Christopher Michel</span> Apr 2, 2021 <span> Brian Woodcock</span> <p> When summer is at its hottest, the last thing we want to do is spend time over a range or in front of a hot oven, cooking. Some days we don't even want to eat anything hot, much less crank up the oven or the stove to cook it. So what to do when we're craving something filling, but it's simply too hot to do any cooking? Well, we bust out one of these refreshingly cool summer soup recipes, get out our immersion blender, and go to town! These chilled soups are perfect for even the most scorching days of the summer. </p> <p> Full discloser: Some do call for heating up veggies just enough to soften them before blending. But others lean on fruits and veggies you're more likely to eat raw. And all are filled with the season's freshest produce. These healthy soup recipes are easy to make, keep well (some taste even better after they've had time to let the flavors marry), and all of them are sure to keep your family satisfied. You could serve these nutritious dishes as a summer side dish at your backyard barbecue , or make them the main course at any weeknight summer dinner . They're also a great pairing with summer salads . Bonus: Little ones won't even realize these recipes are packed with veggies thanks to their bright colors and sweet and savory flavors. Not only are these soups delicious, but they also come together in mere minutes. It doesn't get much better than that!<br> </p> <span> View Gallery</span> <span> <span> 40</span> Photos </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> PAULETTE TAVORMINA</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> 1</span> of 40</span> Golden Gazpacho with Minted Cream <span> </span> <p> Fresh, mint-flecked cream is an elegant final touch to this summery soup of yellow tomatoes, peppers, and squash.</p> <p> <strong> Get the recipe .</strong> </p> <p> SHOP BLENDERS <br> </p> <span> </span> <span> Getty Images</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> 2</span> of 40</span> Sweet Pea and Avocado Soup <span> </span> <p> This minty chilled soup is perfect for picnics, or as an easy, fast, lunch staple.</p> <p> <strong> Get the recipe .</strong> </p> <p> SHOP IMMERSION BLENDERS </p> <span> </span> <span> Tina Rupp</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> 3</span> of 40</span> Cold Avocado Soup <span> </span> <p> Cool and velvety smooth, this delicious soup is the perfect way to start a leisurely summer dinner.
