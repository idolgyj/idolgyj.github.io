Chilled Tomato Basil Soup </h2> <p> Looking for a recipe that tastes like it was just brought out of a restaurant&rsquo;s kitchen? This chilled tomato basil soup does just that! </p> <p> While you can totally opt for fresh tomatoes when available, canned tomatoes also slide. </p> <p> This recipe is mostly made up of root vegetables chopped up and mixed with heavy whipping cream. </p> <p> Can you guess the magic ingredient to this magnificent recipe? Orange juice! </p> <p> A splash of OJ has the power to freshen up the whole pot and add a sweeter taste. </p> <h2> 4.

Now before you run away, hear me out! </p> <p> Rich yogurt paired with fresh herbs and garlic is everything you ever needed, but never knew. </p> <p> Since the recipe is super rich, it&rsquo;s best to serve smaller portions. Instead, add a piece of toast to the side to dip as you devour this delicious cold soup. </p> <p> The best part of this recipe is there is no stove required!</p> <h2> 6. Watermelon Gazpacho </h2> <p> This no-cook recipe is a go-to for when you have last minute guests coming over. </p> <p> It&rsquo;s filled with an array of different flavors and textures that perfectly accentuate one another. </p> <p> If you&rsquo;re a lover of watermelon, jalape&ntilde;os, garlic, and fresh herbs, then you have to give this recipe a try. </p> <p> For a pleasing presentation, serve up this watermelon gazpacho in a martini glass and enjoy! </p> <h2> 7.

Then try out this luscious fruity cold soup. </p> <p> The creamy coconut base mixed with the tanginess of the peach is absolutely mouth watering. </p> <p> The coolest part of this recipe is that you can switch out the peaches for any other fruit you might have on hand. </p> <p> Pro Tip: Don&rsquo;t forget to finish off the recipe with a few slices of fresh fruit! </p> <h2> 8. Chilled Green Pea Soup </h2> <p> The summertime flavor in this recipe is absolutely out of this world. </p> <p> If you&rsquo;re worried about slaving away in the kitchen shelling peas, you&rsquo;re in luck! </p> <p> You can totally get away with using frozen peas while still getting that fresh flavor. </p> <p> Don&rsquo;t forget to garnish the dish with a few frozen peas, dill leaves, and fried onions on top. </p> <h2> 9. Polish Cold Beet Soup With Yogurt (Chlodnik) </h2> <p> This yummy recipe is ideal for my lovers of Polish chlodnik.

Ajo Blanco (Spanish Garlic and Almond Soup) </h2> <p> This fun Spanish dish is super similar to a Gazpacho, however it has its own flair! </p> <p> Can you guess what the main ingredient is? Almonds! </p> <p> This recipe definitely has an interesting mix of ingredients such as almonds, apples, and white bread. </p> <p> Surprisingly, the ingredients perfectly intertwine to create an ideal bowl of yumminess. </p> <p> Don&rsquo;t forget to top the dish with a flew sliced grapes for a little bit more fun! </p> <h2> 11. Chilled Blueberry Soup with Yogurt </h2> <p> While savory cool soups are amazing, sometimes a sweet option is really what we need. </p> <p> Not only does this recipe have a pop of color, but it&rsquo;s also perfect to serve as a light dish. </p> <p> Simply combine some cooled blueberries and yogurt in a blender and process until the ingredients are smooth. </p> <p> Add a slice of ginger and pinch of cinnamon for some extra taste!</p> <h2> 12.

Don&rsquo;t be scared to take a risk with this one! </p> <h2> 21.
